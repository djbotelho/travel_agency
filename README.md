Website made for a college project.

On this website there are 2 types of users, standard and admin.

As a standard user you will be able to book trips to 7 default destinations available on the home page and others that can be added by the admin user.
After booking the user will be able to submit a star review and a comment.

The user can also see all the submitted reviews, see the information of his bookings and cancel them, and change his password.

The Admin has access to the User Management, Destination Management and Logs Menus.

  -In the user management menu the admin is abble to create new users and delete existing ones.

  -In the Destination management menu the admin is able to add new destinations with description and image. 
  
   When doing this a new php page will be created for that destination with the background image that was uploaded.
   The new destination page will appear on the tab called "Other Destinations" in the home page for the standard users.
   The admin user can also remove destinations, but only the ones that were added on the website. The 7 default destinations
   are not allowed to be removed.

  -In the Logs menu the admin will be able to see the time of the bookings and reviews made by the users.
